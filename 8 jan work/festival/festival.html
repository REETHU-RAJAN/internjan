                        <p><aside>Theyyam is a Hindu religious ritual practiced in northern Kerala and some parts of Karnataka. Theyyam is also known as Kaḷiyāṭṭaṁ or Tiṟa. Theyyam consists of traditions, rituals and customs associated with temples and sacred groves of Malabar.[1] The people of the region consider Theyyam itself as a channel to a god and they thus seek blessings from Theyyam.
    
                            In Kerala,Theyyam is performed predominantly in the North Malabar region (consisting of present-day Kasargod, Kannur Districts, Mananthavady Taluk of Wayanad and Vadakara and Koyilandy Taluks of Kozhikode). A similar custom known as Bhuta Kola is followed in the Tulunadu region of neighbouring Karnataka.
                            
                            Theyyam season starts from the tenth day of the Malayalam month of Thulam (usually falls during October, and known as paththaam-udayam) and lasts up to seven months till the middle of Edavam month (typically late May and June). The last Kaliyaattam for the season is performed at Madayi Kavu and Kalarivathukkal Bhagavathy Temple, both being the family shrines of Kolathiri royal family.</aside> </p>

                        <p> Onam, the annual 10-day Malayali harvest festival, will be celebrated this year from August 30 to September 8 with Puli Kali, the ‘tiger dance’ or folk dance form, performed during the fourth day. The 10-day harvest festival of Onam marks the beginning of the Malayalam year ‘Kollavarshamis’ in the state of Kerala and on the fourth day of the festive celebrations, devotees disguise themselves as a tiger by painting their faces and bodies like tigers with stripes of yellow, red or orange and black while dancing to the rhythm of traditional percussion instruments such as thakil, udukku and chenda.

                        <p> One of the oldest traditions of Kerala, Aranmula Boat Race or Aranmula Uthrittathi Vallamkali is a grand event, held between August and September. These boat races are generally held during the harvest season, and perhaps the most important of these is the snake boat race or chundan vallam. An event infused with energy, it sees a number of oarsmen gearing up to row with full vigour, in mesmeric synchronisation. A crowd-puller, the Champakulam Moolam Boat Race is among the oldest races held on the Pampa river, near Alappuzha.</p>
